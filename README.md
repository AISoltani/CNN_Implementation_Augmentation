# CNN_Implementation_Augmentation
Using data augmentation on CNN

I try to augment training data by randomly 
1. flip from left to right
2. flip from top to bottom
3. rotate from -90 degrees to +90 degrees
4. add Gaussian noise with variance 1
5. add Gaussian noise with variance 0.1
6. add Gaussian noise with variance 0.01
In attachment, there are two python files entitled “CNN_Implementation_Augmentation1” and “CNN_Implementation_Augmentation2”. They are for evaluating
test data with randomly horizontal and vertical flipping respectively.
